Inspired by [this](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/vscode/toggle-between-terminals.md), I decided to create my own list of **Today I Learned** snippets that I stumble upon from all the great people I'm connected with.

I will be keeping this list on Github [https://github.com/oliviervaillancourt/til/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/oliviervaillancourt/til/blob/master/README.md)
